# Levana - Implementation Plan

## Document Status

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Draft
**Architecture:** MVI + Koin (per `ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md`)

---

## Development Workflow

Every increment follows this process:

1. **Branch** — Create a feature branch from `master` named `increment-XX-short-description`
2. **Spec** — Write a detailed spec at `specs/increments/INCREMENT_XX.md` covering what will be built, key decisions, and acceptance criteria. Commit this spec to the branch.
3. **Implement** — Build the increment on the branch, committing as needed
4. **Build & Test** — Run `./gradlew build` (and any tests) to verify everything compiles and passes
5. **Review** — User reviews the branch (code + on-device verification against the spec's acceptance criteria)
6. **Merge** — Once approved, merge the branch back into `master`

---

## Dependency Graph

```
1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 ─┬─ 9 → 10 ─┬─ 11 ─┬─ 13
                                   │           │      └─ 15
                                   │           ├─ 12
                                   │           └─ 14
                                   └─ 16 → 17 → 18
```

After Increment 8, work can proceed on two parallel tracks:
- **Feature track:** 9 → 10 → (11, 12, 14 in parallel) → 13 (after 11) and 15 (after 11)
- **Polish track:** 16 → 17 → 18

---

## Key Technical Decisions

These decisions apply across all increments:

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Architecture | MVI | Per `ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md` — predictable state, testable |
| DI | Koin | Per `ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md` — no annotation processing |
| Hebrew calendar | KosherJava | Battle-tested, comprehensive halachic calculations |
| Date/time | `java.time` internally | KosherJava returns `java.util.Date` — convert at repository boundary |
| City data | KosherJava built-in | Per `ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md` — start simple, expand later |
| Network | None | Fully offline — no network calls anywhere |
| Snapshots | State Catalog pattern | Every screen defines explicit state catalogs for Paparazzi |
| Hebrew text | `HebrewDateFormatter` | Never hardcode Hebrew text — always use formatter |
| Min API | 34 (Android 14) | Per `PROJECT_SPEC.md` |

- Holiday model with categories: Torah, Rabbinic, Fast, Minor, Modern Israeli
- MVI triad for detail screen: `DayDetailState`, `DayDetailIntent`, `DayDetailViewModel`
- Navigation route: calendar → day detail (passing date as argument)

**Key technical notes:**
- `JewishCalendar` provides holidays via `getYomTovIndex()` — map to domain `Holiday` model
- Parsha from `JewishCalendar.getParsha()` and `getSpecialShabbos()`
- Omer from `JewishCalendar.getDayOfOmer()`

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [x] Tapping a day in the grid opens the detail screen

- MVI triad: `ZmanimState`, `ZmanimIntent`, `ZmanimViewModel`
- `ZmanimRepository` wrapping `ComplexZmanimCalendar`

**Key technical notes:**
- `ComplexZmanimCalendar` needs a `GeoLocation` — construct from saved `Location`
- All times are `java.util.Date` from KosherJava — convert to `java.time.LocalTime`
- Some zmanim may be `null` (e.g., extreme latitudes) — handle gracefully
- Date picker on zmanim screen to view times for other dates

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [x] Bottom navigation shows Calendar, Zmanim, Settings tabs
- [x] Zmanim screen lists all 13 times grouped by category
- [x] Times are formatted in 12-hour or 24-hour based on system setting
